## Downloading Models

Required for building the image, you must first download the model(s). This can be done with git lfs.

```shell
# Run only once (I think)
git lfs install

# move into models directory and pull down model
cd models
git clone https://huggingface.co/jondurbin/spicyboros-c34b-2.2
```
